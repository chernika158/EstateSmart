### Empowering Real Estate Agents with Instant Property Insights

---

## Overview
EstateSmart is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist real estate agents by providing instant access to crucial property and client information. Built with the goal of enhancing efficiency and delivering faster, more informed responses to clients, EstateSmart leverages call transcripts to enable agents to quickly answer client queries about properties, amenities, and client history, directly from a user-friendly interface.

With EstateSmart, agents can ask questions like:
- "What amenities are available in Property X?"
- "Can you give me details about the client‚Äôs history with Property Y?"
- "What is the pricing and neighborhood information for Property Z?"

This real-time Q&A capability empowers agents with the data they need, making client interactions smoother, more accurate, and more satisfying.

### 2. **Machine Learning & Model Serving:**
   - **Model Deployment:** The Q&A model was developed and deployed on **Databricks**. This platform was chosen for its robust environment that supports data preparation, model training, and deployment under one unified platform.
   - **Serving Endpoint:** EstateSmart‚Äôs model is deployed via **Databricks‚Äô Serving Endpoint**, ensuring that each query from the agent receives a fast, accurate response in real time.

### 3. **Frontend - User Interface:**
   - **Streamlit Application:** The frontend is built using **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive and user-friendly UI where agents can interact with the chatbot. The UI is designed to be simple and responsive, allowing agents to type in questions and instantly view the responses.
